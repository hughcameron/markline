**Markline** converts HTML to Markdown and allows for a transformation pipeline. Transformation techniques of the transformation pipeline are borrowed from data engineering concepts.


## Getting Started

### Installation

Markline is available on PyPI:

```bash
python -m pip install markline
```

---

#### Dependencies

Markdown rendering is performed with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and the command-line tool needs to be available in your environment.

You may follow [the official installation instructions](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)
which are OS-dependent, or if you are a [conda](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=conda+python) user, with the following command:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pandoc
```
