        <p>Most of us are familiar with the way news articles are written to both present news and be engaging. Writing
            a news article is different from writing other articles or informative pieces because news articles present
            information in a specific way, following a specific structure. There are a range of tips and tools used by
            journalists to write news stories: </p>
        <section id="the-headline">
            <h2>The Headline</h2>
            <p>News articles always start with a short, punchy, attention-grabbing headline. Headlines often use: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Alliteration (using the same letter or sound at the beginning of adjacent or closely connected
                    words). For example, “Fed up with festive food waste” or “Harry’s health sees him hurry for home”.
                </li>
                <li>Abbreviations. For example, “Deficit expected to deepen in MYEFO report”. </li>
                <li>Casual language/slang. For example, “‘Intimidating’: 100 brawling youths terrorise at Maccas”.
                    Headlines are typically short, partly to keep them punchy, and partly because of a shortage of
                    space. </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <hr>
        <section id="the-lead">
            <h2>The Lead</h2>
            <p>The first paragraph of a news article is called the lead (leading paragraph). The lead is usually less than 25 words, and
                gives an overview of the event or story. The lead will often explain WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, and WHY.
                The reason for this is that when many people read newspapers, they often only read the first few
                paragraphs of a story, so journalists try to present all the important information first. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Who - who was involved?</li>
                <li>What - what happened?</li>
                <li>Where - where did it happen?</li>
                <li>Why - why did it happen?</li>
                <li>When - when did it happen?</li>
                <li>How - how did it happen?</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <hr>
        <section id="the-body">
            <h2>The Body</h2>
            <p>After the leading paragraph, the rest of the article should be written from most to least important
                information. You can organise your information according to the inverted pyramid (see following page).
                After you’ve listed all the most important facts in your news article, include any additional
                information that might help the reader learn more, such as contact information, additional facts about
                the topic or people involved, or quotes from interviews. When writing a quote in a newspaper article,
                always put the attribution – the ‘he said’ bit – after the quote. </p>
